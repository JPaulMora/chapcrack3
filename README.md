chapcrack3
=================

Hey there! I used this tool and decided to update it for Python3 (Only the RADIUS command), with this I also made it write out hashes for hashcat mode 14000 since cloudcracker.com is now dead. Enjoy.. I hope :)

A tool for parsing and decrypting MS-CHAPv2 network handshakes.

1. 	The first thing you'll need to do is obtain the network traffic 
	for the MS-CHAPv2 handshake you'd like to crack.  

	For PPTP VPN connections, simply use a tool such as tcpdump or 
	wireshark in order to obtain a network capture. 
	For WPA2 Enterprise wireless handshakes, simply use a tool like 
	FreeRADIUS-WPE in order to obtain 'challenge' and 'response' 
	parameters.

2. 	Next you'll use `chapcrack` in order to parse and extract the 
	MS-CHAPv2 handshake from your packet capture or FreeRADIUS 
	interception.

	1.	For a PPTP handshake, run: `chapcrack.py parse -i /path/to/capture.cap`
	2.	For a WPA2 handshake, run `chapcrack.py radius -C <challenge> -R <response>`, where `challenge` and `response` are what you intercepted with
		FreeRADIUS-WPE

3.	Submit the CloudCracker token `chapcrack` gives you to 
	https://www.cloudcracker.com

4.	When you get your results, you can decrypt a PPTP packet capture:
	`chapcrack.py decrypt -i </path/to/capture.cap> -o output.cap -n <result>`
